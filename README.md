# Javascript type validation

## What we will cover

* What is type validation?
* How can we be sure of the data we get?

Notes

JavaScript does not have a strict type system but we can still verify our data
as it comes in to our program.

This is very useful as it allows us to validate the incoming data once and
then we can trust the shape of our data for the rest of the program.

If we want to add types to our project using something like TypeScript or Flow
is recommended but if we are using vanilla JavaScript this approach I have
found to be very useful.
